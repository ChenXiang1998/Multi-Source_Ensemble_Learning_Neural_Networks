# Multi-Source_Ensemble_Learning_Neural_Networks
The code used for the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering paper entitled 'Multi-Source Ensemble Learning for the Remote Prediction of Parkinson's Disease in the Presence of Source-wise Missing Data'

This is the code used for training, validating, and testing the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) described in Section II-C of the manuscript.

Additionally, the customisable script used to download the raw mPower data from Synapse is included and comes with a full description as how to use.

Please contact john.prince@eng.ox.ac.uk for any questions regarding the code or the manuscript.
